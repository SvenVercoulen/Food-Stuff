# Food-Stuff

My idea for this project is to make an application which people can use to improve their health and wellbeing. My initial ideais the following:
An application that tracks the time since you last ate something, drank something and the last time you went outside. I also want this application to track the amount of time you spend outside that day.

Here are some ways I thought of to make use of AI regarding this idea:

1. Smart Reminders & Predictions
Instead of just reminding the user after a fixed time, an AI model could:  
    -Learn personal habits (e.g., you usually drink every 3 hours).  
    -Predict when the user is likely to forget to eat, drink, or go outside.  
    -Suggest reminders at the right time (not too early, not too late).  
Example: If the model sees you skipped meals yesterday at lunchtime, it might proactively nudge you earlier today.
