# Food-Stuff Logs

My idea for this project is to make an application which people can use to improve their health and wellbeing. My initial ideais the following:
An application that tracks the time since you last ate something, drank something and the last time you went outside. I also want this application to track the amount of time you spend outside that day.

Here are some ways I thought of to make use of AI regarding this idea:

---

1. Smart Reminders & Predictions
Instead of just reminding the user after a fixed time, an AI model could:  
 - Learn personal habits (e.g., you usually drink every 3 hours).  
 - Predict when the user is likely to forget to eat, drink, or go outside.  
 - Suggest reminders at the right time (not too early, not too late).  
 - Example: If the model sees you skipped meals yesterday at lunchtime, it might proactively nudge you earlier today.

2. Chatbot Coach
A conversational AI could:
- Let users log events by typing or speaking naturally (If a user types “I just had a sandwich” would be logged as eating).
- Answer questions like:
  - “How long since I last drank water?”
  - “How much time have I spent outside this week?”
- Offer encouragement or tips when it detects unhealthy habits.

3. Pattern Recognition & Insights
An AI system could analyze logs over time to provide personalized insights:
- “You usually go outside more on weekends than weekdays.”
- “You tend to drink less water on days you stay indoors.”
- “You average 25 minutes outside per day; increasing it to 45 minutes could improve your mood and energy.”  
- This can be rule-based at first, but AI can make correlations (e.g., weather vs. your outdoor time).

After some work I have set up a small android application with a simple UI. <br> This UI consists of 3 simple buttons that can be pressed, one for eating, one for drinking and the last for going outside/back inside.
